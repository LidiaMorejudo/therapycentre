### Wireframes

Wireframes for both mobile devices and larger screens (such as tablets and desktop computers) were created using **Balsamiq and Microsoft Word**. The goal was to maintain a clean and straightforward design, with nearly every view having its own dedicated wireframe. This approach streamlined the development process, as the layout and structure were already clearly defined.
