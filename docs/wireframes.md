### Wireframes

Wireframes for both mobile devices and larger screens (such as tablets and desktop computers) were created using **Balsamiq and Microsoft Word**. The goal was to maintain a clean and straightforward design, with nearly every view having its own dedicated wireframe. This approach streamlined the development process, as the layout and structure were already clearly defined.

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this stage of the project. While a few adjustments were made during developmentâ€”particularly to improve responsivenessâ€”I decided to keep all original wireframes unchanged as a reference to the initial design vision.
