All primary pages of the website were validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure compliance with HTML and accessibility standards. The validation results for the Home page, Sessions page, Find Us page, Inquiries page, and Booking page indicate that the markup is free from errors. Any previously identified issues—particularly those related to ARIA attributes and accessibility within modal components—have been successfully resolved. As a result, all validated pages now conform to W3C standards, supporting semantic correctness, accessibility for assistive technologies, and overall code quality.
